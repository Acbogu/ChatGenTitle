However,these approaches still do not consider the relative spatial relationshipsbetween patches within the larger image, which is especially important incomputational pathology. To this end, we introduce a novel MIL model withdistance-aware self-attention (DAS-MIL), which explicitly takes into accountrelative spatial information when modelling the interactions between patches.Unlike existing relative position representations for self-attention which arediscrete, our approach introduces continuous distance-dependent terms into thecomputation of the attention weights, and is the first to apply relativeposition representations in the context of MIL. We evaluate our model on acustom MNIST-based MIL dataset that requires the consideration of relativespatial information, as well as on CAMELYON16, a publicly available cancermetastasis detection dataset, where we achieve a test AUROC score of 0.91. Onboth datasets, our model outperforms existing MIL approaches that employabsolute positional encodings, as well as existing relative positionrepresentation schemes applied to MIL.

Nonetheless, applyingexisting post-training quantization methods directly to low-bit diffusionmodels can significantly impair the quality of generated samples. Specifically,for each denoising step, quantization noise leads to deviations in theestimated mean and mismatches with the predetermined variance schedule.Moreover, as the sampling process proceeds, the quantization noise mayaccumulate, resulting in a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in late denoisingsteps. To address these challenges, we propose a unified formulation for thequantization noise and diffusion perturbed noise in the quantized denoisingprocess.

Such mapping network projects the image featureonce yet does not consider the interaction between the image and the humaninput query. Hence, the obtained visual information with no connections withhuman intention may be inadequate for LLMs to make intention-followingresponses, which we term as static visual information. IPN addresses this issueby allowing the LLM to request the desired visual information aligned withvarious human instructions, which we term as the dynamic interaction betweenthe LLM and visual information. Specifically, IPN consists of a simple visualmapping network to provide the basic perception of an image for LLMs. It alsocontains additional modules responsible for acquiring requests from LLMs,performing request-based visual information interaction, and transmitting theresulting interacted visual information to LLMs, respectively. In this way,LLMs act to understand the human query, deliver the corresponding request tothe request-based visual information interaction module, and generate theresponse based on the interleaved multimodal information.

More specifically, the extended data is projected n-times and the bestclassifier among those n, based on its performance on training data, is chosen.We show that this type of classifier is extremely flexible, as it is likely toapproximate, to an arbitrary precision, any continuous function on a compactset as well as any boolean function on a compact set that splits the supportinto measurable subsets. In particular, given full knowledge of the classconditional densities, the error of these low-complexity classifiers wouldconverge to the optimal (Bayes) error as k and n go to infinity. On the otherhand, if only a training dataset is given, we show that the classifiers willperfectly classify all the training points as k and n go to infinity. We alsobound the generalization error of our random classifiers. In general, ourbounds are better than those for any classifier with VC dimension greater thanO (ln n) . In particular, our bounds imply that, unless the number ofprojections n is extremely large, there is a significant advantageous gapbetween the generalization error of the random projection approach and that ofa linear classifier in the extended space. Asymptotically, as the number ofsamples approaches infinity, the gap persists for any such n. Thus, there is apotentially large gain in generalization properties by selecting parameters atrandom, rather than optimization.", "output": "Optimality and complexity of classification by random projection."}, {"instruction": "If you are an expert in writing papers, please generate a good paper title for this paper based on other authors' descriptions of their abstracts.", "input": "Currently, pre-trained models can be considered the default choice for a widerange of NLP tasks.

In this paper, we explore how different samplingapproaches for generating candidate lists for MBR decoding affect performance.We evaluate popular sampling approaches, such as ancestral, nucleus, and top-ksampling. Based on our insights into their limitations, we experiment with therecently proposed epsilon-sampling approach, which prunes away all tokens witha probability smaller than epsilon, ensuring that each token in a samplereceives a fair probability mass. Through extensive human evaluations, wedemonstrate that MBR decoding based on epsilon-sampling significantlyoutperforms not only beam search decoding, but also MBR decoding with all othertested sampling methods across four language pairs.", "output": "Epsilon Sampling Rocks: Investigating Sampling Strategies for Minimum Bayes Risk Decoding for Machine Translation."}, {"instruction": "If you are an expert in writing papers, please generate a good paper title for this paper based on other authors' descriptions of their abstracts.", "input": "Transgender and non-binary (TGNB) individuals disproportionately experiencediscrimination and exclusion from daily life. Given the recent popularity andadoption of language generation technologies, the potential to furthermarginalize this population only grows. Although a multitude of NLP fairnessliterature focuses on illuminating and addressing gender biases, assessinggender harms for TGNB identities requires understanding how such identitiesuniquely interact with societal gender norms and how they differ from genderbinary-centric perspectives. Such measurement frameworks inherently requirecentering TGNB voices to help guide the alignment between gender-inclusive NLPand whom they are intended to serve. Towards this goal, we ground our work inthe TGNB community and existing interdisciplinary literature to assess how thesocial reality surrounding experienced marginalization by TGNB personscontributes to and persists within Open Language Generation (OLG). By firstunderstanding their marginalization stressors, we evaluate (1) misgendering and(2) harmful responses to gender disclosure. To do this, we introduce the TANGOdataset, comprising of template-based text curated from real-world text withina TGNB-oriented community. We discover a dominance of binary gender normswithin the models; LLMs least misgendered subjects in generated text whentriggered by prompts whose subjects used binary pronouns. Meanwhile,misgendering was most prevalent when triggering generation with singular theyand neopronouns. When prompted with gender disclosures, LLM text containedstigmatizing language and scored most toxic when triggered by TGNB genderdisclosure. Our findings warrant further research on how TGNB harms manifest inLLMs and serve as a broader case study toward concretely grounding the designof gender-inclusive AI in community voices and interdisciplinary literature.", "output": "\"I'm fully who I am\": Towards Centering Transgender and Non-Binary Voices to Measure Biases in Open Language Generation."}, {"instruction": "If you are an expert in writing papers, please generate a good paper title for this paper based on other authors' descriptions of their abstracts.", "input": "We prove Wasserstein inverse reinforcement learning enables the learner'sreward values to imitate the expert's reward values in a finite iteration formulti-objective optimizations.

However, withtheir widespread deployment, there is a general lack of research thatthoroughly discusses and analyzes the potential risks concealed. In that case,we intend to conduct a preliminary but pioneering study covering therobustness, consistency, and credibility of LLMs systems. With most of therelated literature in the era of LLM uncharted, we propose an automatedworkflow that copes with an upscaled number of queries/responses. Overall, weconduct over a million queries to the mainstream LLMs including ChatGPT, LLaMA,and OPT. Core to our workflow consists of a data primitive, followed by anautomated interpreter that evaluates these LLMs under different adversarialmetrical systems. As a result, we draw several, and perhaps unfortunate,conclusions that are quite uncommon from this trendy community. Briefly, theyare: (i)-the minor but inevitable error occurrence in the user-generated queryinput may, by chance, cause the LLM to respond unexpectedly; (ii)-LLMs possesspoor consistency when processing semantically similar query input. In addition,as a side finding, we find that ChatGPT is still capable to yield the correctanswer even when the input is polluted at an extreme level. While thisphenomenon demonstrates the powerful memorization of the LLMs, it raisesserious concerns about using such data for LLM-involved evaluation in academicdevelopment. To deal with it, we propose a novel index associated with adataset that roughly decides the feasibility of using such data forLLM-involved evaluation.
