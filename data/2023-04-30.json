The high-gradebrain tumors are easier to recurrent even after standard treatment. Therefore,developing a method to predict brain tumor recurrence location plays animportant role in the treatment planning and it can potentially prolongpatient's survival time. There is still little work to deal with this issue. Inthis paper, we present a deep learning-based brain tumor recurrence locationprediction network. Since the dataset is usually small, we propose to usetransfer learning to improve the prediction. We first train a multi-modal braintumor segmentation network on the public dataset BraTS 2021. Then, thepre-trained encoder is transferred to our private dataset for extracting therich semantic features. Following that, a multi-scale multi-channel featurefusion model and a nonlinear correlation learning module are developed to learnthe effective features. The correlation between multi-channel features ismodeled by a nonlinear equation. To measure the similarity between thedistributions of original features of one modality and the estimated correlatedfeatures of another modality, we propose to use Kullback-Leibler divergence.Based on this divergence, a correlation loss function is designed to maximizethe similarity between the two feature distributions. Finally, two decoders areconstructed to jointly segment the present brain tumor and predict its futuretumor recurrence location. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first workthat can segment the present tumor and at the same time predict future tumorrecurrence location, making the treatment planning more efficient and precise.The experimental results demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed methodto predict the brain tumor recurrence location from the limited dataset.", "output": "Prediction of brain tumor recurrence location based on multi-modal fusion and nonlinear correlation learning."}, {"instruction": "If you are an expert in writing papers, please generate a good paper title for this paper based on other authors' descriptions of their abstracts.", "input": "Increased capabilities such as recognition and self-adaptability are nowrequired from IoT applications.

As VQT keeps the intermediate features intact and only learnsto combine them, it enjoys memory efficiency in training, compared to manyother parameter-efficient fine-tuning approaches that learn to adapt featuresand need back-propagation through the entire backbone. This also suggests thecomplementary role between VQT and those approaches in transfer learning.Empirically, VQT consistently surpasses the state-of-the-art approach thatutilizes intermediate features for transfer learning and outperforms fullfine-tuning in many cases. Compared to parameter-efficient approaches thatadapt features, VQT achieves much higher accuracy under memory constraints.Most importantly, VQT is compatible with these approaches to attain even higheraccuracy, making it a simple add-on to further boost transfer learning.", "output": "Visual Query Tuning: Towards Effective Usage of Intermediate Representations for Parameter and Memory Efficient Transfer Learning."}, {"instruction": "If you are an expert in writing papers, please generate a good paper title for this paper based on other authors' descriptions of their abstracts.", "input": "In many real-world settings agents engage in strategic interactions withmultiple opposing agents who can employ a wide variety of strategies.

Tobridge the gap between IL and RL, we introduce Distance Weighted SupervisedLearning or DWSL, a supervised method for learning goal-conditioned policiesfrom offline data. DWSL models the entire distribution of time-steps betweenstates in offline data with only supervised learning, and uses thisdistribution to approximate shortest path distances. To extract a policy, weweight actions by their reduction in distance estimates. Theoretically, DWSLconverges to an optimal policy constrained to the data distribution, anattractive property for offline learning, without any bootstrapping. Across alldatasets we test, DWSL empirically maintains behavior cloning as a lower boundwhile still exhibiting policy improvement. In high-dimensional image domains,DWSL surpasses the performance of both prior goal-conditioned IL and RLalgorithms.

In this work, we eliminate this bottleneck by selectingthe best representation based on the Gromov-Wasserstein Discrepancy (GWD)between the raw events and their representation. It is approximately 200 timesfaster to compute than training a neural network and preserves the taskperformance ranking of event representations across multiple representations,network backbones, and datasets. This means that finding a representation witha high task score is equivalent to finding a representation with a low GWD. Weuse this insight to, for the first time, perform a hyperparameter search on alarge family of event representations, revealing new and powerfulrepresentations that exceed the state-of-the-art. On object detection, ouroptimized representation outperforms existing representations by 1.9% mAP onthe 1 Mpx dataset and 8.6% mAP on the Gen1 dataset and even outperforms thestate-of-the-art by 1.8% mAP on Gen1 and state-of-the-art feed-forward methodsby 6.0% mAP on the 1 Mpx dataset.

There is a pervasive sense in the generative modeling community thatthe various flow and diffusion-based generative models have some foundationalcommon structure and interrelationships. We establish connections between MFGsand major classes of flow and diffusion-based generative models includingcontinuous-time normalizing flows, score-based models, and Wasserstein gradientflows. We derive these three classes of generative models through differentchoices of particle dynamics and cost functions. Furthermore, we study themathematical structure and properties of each generative model by studyingtheir associated MFG's optimality condition, which is a set of couplednonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs). The theory of MFGs, therefore,enables the study of generative models through the theory of nonlinear PDEs.Through this perspective, we investigate the well-posedness and structure ofnormalizing flows, unravel the mathematical structure of score-based generativemodeling, and derive a mean-field game formulation of the Wasserstein gradientflow. From an algorithmic perspective, the optimality conditions of MFGs alsoallow us to introduce HJB regularizers for enhanced training a broader class ofgenerative models. We present this framework as an MFG laboratory which servesas a platform for revealing new avenues of experimentation and invention ofgenerative models. This laboratory will give rise to a multitude of well-posedgenerative modeling formulations, providing a consistent theoretical frameworkupon which numerical and algorithmic tools may be developed.", "output": "A mean-field games laboratory for generative modeling."}, {"instruction": "If you are an expert in writing papers, please generate a good paper title for this paper based on other authors' descriptions of their abstracts.", "input": "This paper presents a comprehensive and practical guide for practitioners andend-users working with Large Language Models (LLMs) in their downstream naturallanguage processing (NLP) tasks.

Most importantly, we provide a detailed discussion aboutthe use and non-use cases of large language models for various natural languageprocessing tasks, such as knowledge-intensive tasks, traditional naturallanguage understanding tasks, natural language generation tasks, emergentabilities, and considerations for specific tasks.We present various use casesand non-use cases to illustrate the practical applications and limitations ofLLMs in real-world scenarios. We also try to understand the importance of dataand the specific challenges associated with each NLP task. Furthermore, weexplore the impact of spurious biases on LLMs and delve into other essentialconsiderations, such as efficiency, cost, and latency, to ensure acomprehensive understanding of deploying LLMs in practice.

The challenge of dealing with thecomplexities and noise within electronic health records (EHRs) has motivatedapplications of machine learning in phenotypic discovery. While recent researchhas focused on finding predictive subtypes for clinical decision support, herewe instead focus on the noise that results in phenotypic misclassification,which can reduce a phenotypes ability to detect associations in genome-wideassociation studies (GWAS). We show that by combining anchor learning andtransformer architectures into our proposed model, AnchorBERT, we are able todetect genomic associations only previously found in large consortium studieswith 5$times$ more cases. When reducing the number of controls available by50%, we find our model is able to maintain 40% more significant genomicassociations from the GWAS catalog compared to standard phenotype definitions.keywords{Phenotyping and Machine Learning and Semi-Supervised and GeneticAssociation Studies and Biological Discovery}", "output": "Phenotyping with Positive Unlabelled Learning for Genome-Wide Association Studies."}]
