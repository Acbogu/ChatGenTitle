Each client employs gradient descentto adapt the initialization to local data distributions quickly to realizemodel personalization. However, due to non-convex loss function and randomnessof sampling update, meta-learning approaches have unstable goals in localadaptation for the same client. This fluctuation in different adaptationdirections hinders the convergence in meta-learning. To overcome thischallenge, we use the historical local adapted model to restrict the directionof the inner loop and propose an elastic-constrained method. As a result, thecurrent round inner loop keeps historical goals and adapts to better solutions.Experiments show our method boosts meta-learning convergence and improvespersonalization without additional calculation and communication.

One way to measure and enforce suchrobustness and performance uniformity is through enforcing it during training,assuming identity-related information is available at scale.

One way to measure and enforce suchrobustness and performance uniformity is through enforcing it during training,assuming identity-related information is available at scale.

However, most of theexisting HO-GNNs are hop-based, i.e., they rely on the powers of the transitionmatrix. As a result, these architectures are not fully reactive to theclassification loss and the achieved structural filters have static supports.In other words, neither the filters' supports nor their coefficients can belearned with these networks. They are confined, instead, to learn combinationsof filters. To address the above concerns, we propose Diffusion-jump GNNs amethod relying on asymptotic diffusion distances that operates on jumps. Adiffusion-pump generates pairwise distances whose projections determine boththe support and coefficients of each structural filter. These filters arecalled jumps because they explore a wide range of scales in order to find bondsbetween scattered nodes with the same label. Actually, the full process iscontrolled by the classification loss. Both the jumps and the diffusiondistances react to classification errors (i.e. they are learnable).Homophiliation, i.e., the process of learning piecewise smooth latent spaces inthe heterophilic regime, is formulated as a Dirichlet problem: the known labelsdetermine the border nodes and the diffusion-pump ensures a minimal deviationof the semi-supervised grouping from a canonical unsupervised grouping. Thistriggers the update of both the diffusion distances and, consequently, thejumps in order to minimize the classification error. The Dirichlet formulationhas several advantages.

Large weights indeep neural networks are a sign of a more complex network that is overfitted tothe training data. Moreover, regularized networks tend to have a greater rangeof weights around zero with fewer weights centered at zero. We introduce aweight reparameterization function which is applied to each weight andimplicitly reduces overfitting by restricting the magnitude of the weightswhile forcing them away from zero at the same time. This leads to a moredemocratic decision-making in the network. Firstly, individual weights cannothave too much influence in the prediction process due to the restriction oftheir magnitude. Secondly, more weights are used in the prediction process,since they are forced away from zero during the training. This promotes theextraction of more features from the input data and increases the level ofweight redundancy, which makes the network less sensitive to statisticaldifferences between training and test data. We extend our method to learn thehyperparameters of the introduced weight reparameterization function.

A number of approaches have been proposedto address these drawbacks such as extra regularization, adversarial weightsperturbation, and training with more data over the last few years. However, therobust generalization improvement is yet far from satisfactory. In this paper,we approach this challenge with a brand new perspective -- refining historicaloptimization trajectories. We propose a new method named textbf{WeightedOptimization Trajectories (WOT)} that leverages the optimization trajectoriesof adversarial training in time. We have conducted extensive experiments todemonstrate the effectiveness of WOT under various state-of-the-art adversarialattacks. Our results show that WOT integrates seamlessly with the existingadversarial training methods and consistently overcomes the robust overfittingissue, resulting in better adversarial robustness. For example, WOT boosts therobust accuracy of AT-PGD under AA-$L_{infty}$ attack by 1.53% $sim$ 6.11%and meanwhile increases the clean accuracy by 0.55%$sim$5.47% across SVHN,CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet datasets.", "output": "Enhancing Adversarial Training via Reweighting Optimization Trajectory."}, {"instruction": "If you are an expert in writing papers, please generate a good paper title for this paper based on other authors' descriptions of their abstracts.", "input": "The widely used stochastic gradient methods for minimizing nonconvexcomposite objective functions require the Lipschitz smoothness of thedifferentiable part. But the requirement does not hold true for problem classesincluding quadratic inverse problems and training neural networks. To addressthis issue, we investigate a family of stochastic Bregman proximal gradient(SBPG) methods, which only require smooth adaptivity of the differentiablepart. SBPG replaces the upper quadratic approximation used in SGD with theBregman proximity measure, resulting in a better approximation model thatcaptures the non-Lipschitz gradients of the nonconvex objective. We formulatethe vanilla SBPG and establish its convergence properties under nonconvexsetting without finite-sum structure. Experimental results on quadratic inverseproblems testify the robustness of SBPG. Moreover, we propose a momentum-basedversion of SBPG (MSBPG) and prove it has improved convergence properties. Weapply MSBPG to the training of deep neural networks with a polynomial kernelfunction, which ensures the smooth adaptivity of the loss function.Experimental results on representative benchmarks demonstrate the effectivenessand robustness of MSBPG in training neural networks. Since the additionalcomputation cost of MSBPG compared with SGD is negligible in large-scaleoptimization, MSBPG can potentially be employed as an universal open-sourceoptimizer in the future.", "output": "Nonconvex Stochastic Bregman Proximal Gradient Method with Application to Deep Learning."}, {"instruction": "If you are an expert in writing papers, please generate a good paper title for this paper based on other authors' descriptions of their abstracts.", "input": "Spectral clustering is one of the most popular unsupervised machine learningmethods. Constructing similarity matrix is crucial to this type of method. Inmost existing works, the similarity matrix is computed once for all or isupdated alternatively. However, the former is difficult to reflectcomprehensive relationships among data points, and the latter is time-consumingand is even infeasible for large-scale problems. In this work, we propose arestarted clustering framework with self-guiding and block diagonalrepresentation. An advantage of the strategy is that some useful clusteringinformation obtained from previous cycles could be preserved as much aspossible. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that appliesrestarting strategy to spectral clustering. The key difference is that wereclassify the samples in each cycle of our method, while they are classifiedonly once in existing methods. To further release the overhead, we introduce ablock diagonal representation with Nystr\"{o}m approximation for constructingthe similarity matrix. Theoretical results are established to show therationality of inexact computations in spectral clustering.

Recent research has shown that applyingzeroth-order optimization (ZOO) has many advantages in building a practical VFLalgorithm. However, a vital problem with the ZOO-based VFL is its slowconvergence rate, which limits its application in handling modern large models.To address this problem, we propose a cascaded hybrid optimization method inVFL. In this method, the downstream models (clients) are trained with ZOO toprotect privacy and ensure that no internal information is shared. Meanwhile,the upstream model (server) is updated with first-order optimization (FOO)locally, which significantly improves the convergence rate, making it feasibleto train the large models without compromising privacy and security. Wetheoretically prove that our VFL framework converges faster than the ZOO-basedVFL, as the convergence of our framework is not limited by the size of theserver model, making it effective for training large models with the major parton the server. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achievesfaster convergence than the ZOO-based VFL framework, while maintaining anequivalent level of privacy protection. Moreover, we show that the convergenceof our VFL is comparable to the unsafe FOO-based VFL baseline.
