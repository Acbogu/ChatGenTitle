In this paper, we propose a hierarchical dynamicnetwork (HDNet) to adapt features from local to global view for better featuretransformation in efficient image harmonization. Inspired by the success ofvarious dynamic models, local dynamic (LD) module and mask-aware global dynamic(MGD) module are proposed in this paper. Specifically, LD matches localrepresentations between the foreground and background regions based on semanticsimilarities, then adaptively adjust every foreground local representationaccording to the appearance of its $K$-nearest neighbor background regions. Inthis way, LD can produce more realistic images at a more fine-grained level,and simultaneously enjoy the characteristic of semantic alignment. The MGDeffectively applies distinct convolution to the foreground and background,learning the representations of foreground and background regions as well astheir correlations to the global harmonization, facilitating local visualconsistency for the images much more efficiently. Experimental resultsdemonstrate that the proposed HDNet significantly reduces the total modelparameters by more than 80% compared to previous methods, while stillattaining state-of-the-art performance on the popular iHarmony4 dataset.Notably, the HDNet achieves a 4% improvement in PSNR and a 19% reduction inMSE compared to the prior state-of-the-art methods.", "output": "Hierarchical Dynamic Image Harmonization."}, {"instruction": "If you are an expert in writing papers, please generate a good paper title for this paper based on other authors' descriptions of their abstracts.", "input": "Reasoning, as an essential ability for complex problem-solving, can provideback-end support for various real-world applications, such as medicaldiagnosis, negotiation, etc. This paper provides a comprehensive survey ofcutting-edge research on reasoning with language model prompting.

To addressthis, performing pruning and quantization jointly is essential.

In this work, wedevelop a diversified and realistic augmentation method that can flexiblyconstruct a whole-body object, freely locate and rotate the object, and applyself-occlusion and external-occlusion accordingly. To improve the diversity ofthe whole-body object construction, we develop an iterative method thatstochastically combines multiple objects observed from the real world into asingle object. Unlike the existing augmentation methods, the constructedobjects can be randomly located and rotated in the training frame becauseproper occlusions can be reflected to the whole-body objects in the final step.Finally, proper self-occlusion at each local object level andexternal-occlusion at the global frame level are applied using the Hidden PointRemoval (HPR) algorithm that is computationally efficient. HPR is also used foradaptively controlling the point density of each object according to theobject's distance from the LiDAR. Experiment results show that the proposedDR.CPO algorithm is data-efficient and model-agnostic without incurring anycomputational overhead. Also, DR.CPO can improve mAP performance by 2.08% whencompared to the best 3D detection result known for KITTI dataset.

Additionally, obtaining pairedlow-field and high-field MR images is often not practical. We theoreticallyuncovered that the combination of these challenges renders conventional deeplearning methods that directly learn the mapping from a low-field MR image to ahigh-field MR image unsuitable. To overcome these challenges, we introduce anovel meta-learning approach that employs a teacher-student mechanism. Firstly,an optimal-transport-driven teacher learns the degradation process fromhigh-field to low-field MR images and generates pseudo-paired high-field andlow-field MRI images. Then, a score-based student solves the inverse problem ofreconstructing a high-field-like MR image from a low-field MRI within theframework of iterative regularization, by learning the joint distribution ofpseudo-paired images to act as a regularizer.

To date, there is limited research investigatingthe real-world educational value of AI-generated synthetic media. To addressthis gap, we examined the impact of using AI-generated synthetic video in anonline learning platform on both learners content acquisition and learningexperience. We took a mixed-method approach, randomly assigning adult learners(n=83) into one of two micro-learning conditions, collecting pre- andpost-learning assessments, and surveying participants on their learningexperience. The control condition included a traditionally produced instructorvideo, while the experimental condition included a synthetic video with arealistic AI-generated character. The results show that learners in bothconditions demonstrated significant improvement from pre- to post-learning(p&lt;.001), with no significant differences in gains between the two conditions(p=.80).
